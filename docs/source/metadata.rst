Viewing file metadata with ncdump
--------------------------------------
The metadata for files that have been downloaded from this server can be found using multiple tools specific to working with netCDF files.

One recommended tool for viewing this metadata and working with netCDF files, in general, is a set of command-line programs called the NetCDF Operators (NCO). These can be downloaded from http://nco.sourceforge.net/ and installed following instructions on that page.

Once you have the NCO programs installed, you can use the ``ncdump`` command to view the metadata for any netCDF file.

``$ ncdump -h filename.nc``

.. note::

   For more options when using ``ncdump``, see `unidata.ucar.edu <https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/workshops/2011/utilities/NcdumpExamples.html>`_.
