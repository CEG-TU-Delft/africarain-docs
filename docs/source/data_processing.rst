Production of processed data files
==================================

Data processing steps
---------------------
**Data available for download have been processed from their original raw form.** The following steps were taken to produce processed data:

1. step 1
2. step 2
3. step 3

Raw data files are maintained separately and due to their large volume, are not made available via the THREDDS server along with the processed data. If your research project requires access to raw simulation data, please contact Nick van de Giesen (N.C.vandeGiesen@tudelft.nl) to request access. 

---------------

Georeferencing information
--------------------------

The projection of the processed data is [Lambert Conformal] with the true latitudes 1 and 2 being 20 and 0 degrees, respectively. The standard longitude is 5 degrees.

Time period
-----------
Processed data are created from raw simulation data as they are generated by the WCG volunteer program on a rolling basis. The period of processed covered will ultimately run from 1 June 2018 until 31 May 2019. The dataset is expected to be complete in mid-2022. Processed data are avaialbe at a 1-hour time interval. 

---------------

Spatial resolution 
------------------
Processed data are available at 1-km scale.
