Project goals
-------------
The goal of the African Rainfall Project is to derive accurate rainfall estimates over Sub-Saharan Africa, with the help of a high-resolution (1km) application of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF).  Such a resolution will allow the model to better represent rainfall, and in particular, convective precipitation. This is a unique experiment that has never been performed at such a scale. The model runs on the IBM World Community Grid (WCG), a SCR activity of IBM.

These data can be used to:
+ Help scientists better understand these storms and improve forecasting models
+ Produce more accurate rainfall forecasts for sub-Saharan Africa
+ Give farmers more timely information about when to plant, help them obtain insurance
+ Support resilience in the face of climate change

.. note::
   **Reflection.**
   “The finer the grid we calculate with, the better we capture rainfall and convective (localized) rainstorms. But we’ve never been able to push that to the end—looking at weather patterns at a level of 500 meters to 1 kilometer. This is the first time we’ll be able to map huge parts of Africa for a whole rainy season, and has never been done before at this level of resolution. This is only possible because of the amount of computing power we'll have through World Community Grid.” - Nick van de Giesen, Principal Investigator

In addition the aim is to link African schools with partner schools in Europe and the United States to foster international school partnerships.”
+ Ground-based data from the Trans-African Hydro-Meteorological Observatory (TAHMO): “TAHMO’s goal is to install 20,000 on-the-ground sensing stations every 30 km across the African continent, specifically designed to provide rainfall, temperature, and other critical data from robust redundant sensors. The data recorded every five minutes is sent via a cellular network near real time to a server where the data undergoes quality control before being made available on our online data portal for downloading” (https://tahmo.org/school-2-school-initiative/)
